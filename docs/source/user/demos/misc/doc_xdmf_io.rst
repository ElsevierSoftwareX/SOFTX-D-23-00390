Writing and reading XDMF files via cashocs
==========================================

In this tutorial, we investigate how cashocs can be used to write out XDMF files containing parts of the solution and, more interestingly, how these files can be read again for post-processing. This demo uses :ref:`demo_shape_poisson` as an example problem and performs a post-processing of the obtained geometries and solution files, visualizing them from python.
